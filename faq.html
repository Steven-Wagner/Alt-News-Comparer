            <p>The primary goal is to give users a more wholistic understanding of the different view points
                and spin that can be put on the same event or news story. To do this, we have provided tools to compare alternative 
                news media with news normally considered more mainstream. Offering quick info on news biases, linking to fact
                checking articles, and providing very differing comments and opionions from people around the world.

                <h2><a name="bias-cred"></a>How do you calculate bias and credibility?</a></h2>
                <p>Bias and credibility are not easy things to measure and will always be subject to its own level of
                    bias. The current scores for each news outlet are compiled from: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adfontesmedia.com/">www.adfontesmedia.com</a></p>
                <p>The scores on this website are nothing more than suggestive guides to give a better context for you, the user,
                    in undertsanding the different view points being presented. It is also important to realize that 
                    scores are based on an aynalysis of many articles and may not corraspond to all articles for that news source.
