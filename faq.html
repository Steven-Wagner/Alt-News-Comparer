                <p>The primary goal is to give users a more holistic understanding of the different viewpoints and spin 
                    that can be put on the same event or news story. To do this, we have provided tools to compare 
                    alternative news media with news normally considered more mainstream. Offering quick info on news 
                    biases, linking to fact-checking articles, and providing very different comments and opinions from 
                    people around the world.

                    <h2><a name="bias-cred"></a>How do you calculate bias and credibility?</a></h2>
                    <p>Bias and credibility are not easy things to measure and will always be subject to its own level of
                        bias. The current scores for each news outlet are compiled from: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adfontesmedia.com/">www.adfontesmedia.com</a></p>
                    <p>The scores on this website are nothing more than suggestive guides to give a better context for you, the user,
                            in understanding the different viewpoints being presented. It is also important to realize 
                            that scores are based on an analysis of many articles and may not correspond to all articles 
                            for that news source.

                <p>News Comparer uses a database to search through news from the last 30 days and displays the 10 most recent

                        and be aware that news from over 1 month ago might not be included in the results.
